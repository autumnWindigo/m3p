			<strong>Your Music, Your Way:</strong>Welcome to Minimal Multi-platform Music Player (M3P),where music meets customization and control.
			At its core, M3P is more than just a music player; it's a versatile and hackable platform designed
			to adapt to your unique preferences.<br></br> <strong>The Foundation: An Extensible Music Player.</strong>
			M3P starts as a simple list of songs in a folder, providing the fundamental ability to play your music. However, what sets it apart is
			its hackable configuration file, enabling you to transform the player into something far beyond the basics. <br></br>
			<strong>Multiplatform Magic with Music Player Daemon (MPD)</strong>
			Embracing the power of Music Player Daemon (MPD), M3P becomes a multiplatform marvel. MPD facilitates music playback across various sound servers,
			making M3P compatible with Linux distributions, Android, Apple, and Windows. With playlist capabilities and essential music player features, MPD lays
			the foundation for M3P's expansive capabilities.<br></br>
			<strong>Customization: Tailor Your Music Experience</strong>M3P stands out in the crowded music player landscape due to its emphasis on customization. Unlike other services, M3P provides a more minimalistic 
			base, allowing users to shape their music player according to their desires. In an era where personalization is key, M3P empowers users to infuse 
			their personality into their music experience.<br></br>
			<strong>Tagging Mastery: Unleash the Power of Information</strong>Tagging is the unsung hero of M3P, offering unparalleled control over your music 
			library. Automate tagging based on parameters you set, transforming messy data into organized information. From cleaning up artist names to trimming 
			unnecessary content, M3P ensures that your music library reflects your preferences.<br></br>
			<strong>Artwork Awesomeness: Visualize Your Music</strong>Visualizing your music goes beyond desktop experiences. M3P leverages tags and metadata 
			to manage album artwork seamlessly. For Android users, the "ALBUM" tag becomes the key to unique and personalized album art. Navigate the visual
			landscape of your music effortlessly, with each song having its distinct image.<br></br>
			<strong>Seamless Transition: From Cloud to Local</strong>Moving your library from a cloud service to a local program has never been easier. M3P 
			simplifies the transition by allowing you to link a public Spotify playlist, effortlessly finding alternative options for easy song downloads. 
			Say goodbye to the hassle of moving an entire library; now, it's as simple as pasting a link and clicking a few buttons.<br></br>
			<strong>Audio Visualizer: A Symphony of Creativity</strong>Unleash your creativity with M3P's audio visualizer. While creating a hackable 
			visualizer is a challenging feat, M3P envisions a platform where creative tty visualizers seamlessly interface with other programs. Imagine 
			a unique, customizable audio-visual experience that truly complements your music journey.<br></br>
			M3P is not just a music player; it's a canvas for your musical expression. Dive into the world of M3P, where your music takes center stage, 
			tailored to your preferences, and brought to life with unrivaled customization.
